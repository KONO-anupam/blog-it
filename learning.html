            <p class="mb-1">
                I already knew about HTML, CSS and JavaScript and their importance in developing websites but was never
                really motivated to learn more about them.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-7">
                However, on 27th December, 2024, the orientation session for freshers and sophomores was held. I finally
                had an excuse to get into WebDev.

            <p class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Resources</p>
            <p class="mb-1">
                Like any average beginner, the first place I ended up seeking resources on was YouTube. I hopped from
                one channel to another, searching for the best one. I ended up wasting almost 2 days in this fruitless
                pursuit.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-1">
                By the evening of the second day, tired of scrolling through YouTube, I was surfing Reddit. It was then
                that I stumbled across this incredible website called <span class="font-semibold">The Odin
                    Project</span>.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-1">
                The Odin Project is one of those "What I wish I had when I was learning" resources. Not everyone has
                access to a computer science education or the funds to attend an intensive coding school, and neither of
                those is right for everyone anyway. This project is designed to fill in the gap for people who are
                trying to hack it on their own but still want a high-quality education. On top of that, its vibrant
                Discord community is always ready to help with any problem. Through this resource, I learned HTML and
                CSS.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-1">
                For learning Tailwind CSS, I used the Code with Harry playlist on YouTube.
